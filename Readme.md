# Build
Since this is python script nothing has to be compiled. You just have to install Python 2.7. Either from python.org or via package management (e.g. yum install python or apt-get install python)

# Usage
In the (unix)shell just enter this:
>> ./encoder.py <input_file> <output_file>

# Testing
To run the tests you just have to execute tests.py

# brute.py
bute.py was just a little test script. I wanted to see how many chars where missing and how far it would take me without making any assumptions.
